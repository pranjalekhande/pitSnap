# 00 - AR Filter Feature Brief

## Feature Intent

The primary goal of this initiative is to rework the existing 2D camera filter system into a high-performance, real-time Augmented Reality (AR) experience.

## Core Experience

The new system will enable users to apply interactive, 3D filters related to Formula 1 content. Key examples include:

1.  **AR Helmets**: Realistically overlaying 3D models of F1 driver helmets onto the user's head, accurately tracking their movements in 3D space.
2.  **Podium Experience**: Using background segmentation to "cut out" the user from their environment and place them into a virtual 3D scene, such as an F1 podium celebration.

## Technical Goals

-   **Robustness**: Build a stable and reliable system that handles real-time video processing efficiently.
-   **Performance**: Ensure a smooth, high-framerate user experience on a range of devices.
-   **Scalability**: Create a modular architecture that allows for the easy addition of new AR effects, 3D models, and tracking technologies in the future.
