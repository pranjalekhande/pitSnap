**Race Winner Strategy - Max Verstappen:**
• Started on Medium tires
• First pit: Lap 18 → Medium tires (2.3s stop)  
• Second pit: Lap 38 → Hard tires (2.1s stop)
• Result: Won by 7.456 seconds

**Alternative Strategies:**
• **Charles Leclerc (P2):** Similar two-stop but pitted earlier (laps 16, 35)
• **George Russell (P3):** One-stop strategy - Medium → Hard on lap 20
• **Lando Norris (P4):** Aggressive three-stop with soft tire finale

**Strategic Key Points:**
✓ Two-stop was optimal for tire degradation
✓ Hard tires showed excellent longevity in final stint  
✓ Pit window timing was crucial (laps 16-20)
✓ Verstappen's tire management was superior throughout

**What-If Scenario:**
If Verstappen had pitted 5 laps earlier, he likely would have won by an even larger margin due to better undercut opportunities."""
