KEY STRATEGIC TRENDS:
- McLaren's dominance: Both drivers consistently scoring points
- Mercedes resurgence: Russell and Antonelli competitive again  
- Red Bull struggles: Verstappen fighting for podiums, not wins
- Ferrari inconsistency: Leclerc and Sainz alternating good/bad races

TIRE STRATEGY INSIGHTS:
- Medium compound proving most versatile in 2025
- Two-stop strategies more common due to tire degradation
- Track position crucial with reduced DRS effectiveness
- Pit window management deciding race outcomes

CHAMPIONSHIP BATTLE:
- Piastri vs Norris internal McLaren fight
- 22-point gap between McLaren teammates
- Verstappen within striking distance if McLaren falters
- Team orders could become crucial for McLaren""",
