# 00 - Pit Wall: Feature Brief

## Feature Intent

The purpose of this initiative is to build the **Pit Wall**, a dynamic and intelligent content feed that acts as a user's personal race strategist. It will combine live F1 data with proactive, AI-generated context and recommendations, powered by the **Paddock AI**'s RAG capabilities.

## Core Experience

The feed will present a unified view of three types of content, with the Paddock AI acting as the master curator:

1.  **Intelligent & Curated Content**: This includes proactive AI insights explaining live events, as well as recommended official F1 articles, videos, and track maps for upcoming races. Card with "undercut" strategy, drawing its knowledge from our curated F1 database.

2.  **Core Race Data**: Standard data cards for showing standard race data, results, standings, and schedules etc.

3.  **Community Stories**: A prominent carousel of 24-hour stories from users, preserving the user-generated content aspect of the app.

This combined feed will replace the current standalone "Stories Screen" to become a primary engagement point for users.

## Future Goals (Post-MVP)

-   **Personalization**: Evolve the feed into a recommendation system that surfaces content based on the user's interests (favorite drivers, teams, etc.).
-   **Rich Media**: Integrate video highlights, team radio clips, and interactive charts.

## Technical Goals

-   **Data Integration**: Build a robust pipeline to ingest data from a reliable F1 data API.
-   **Scalable UI**: Design a flexible component-based UI that can handle various types of data cards and content formats.
-   **Performance**: Ensure the feed loads quickly and scrolls smoothly, even with a large amount of content.
