**Actual Strategy:** Two-stop (Medium â†’ Medium â†’ Hard)
**What if he had pitted 5 laps earlier?**

**Predicted Alternative Outcome:**
â€¢ Would have gained undercut advantage over Leclerc
â€¢ Could have won by 12-15 seconds instead of 7.456s
â€¢ Better tire management in final stint
â€¢ Lower risk of late-race pressure

**Strategic Analysis:**
âœ“ Earlier pit = better track position
âœ“ Fresher tires for longer period  
âœ“ More strategic flexibility
âœ— Slightly more laps on degraded rubber

**Conclusion:** Earlier pit strategy would have been even more dominant."""

**Key What-If Factors:**
â€¢ **Tire Choice:** Aggressive vs Conservative compound selection
