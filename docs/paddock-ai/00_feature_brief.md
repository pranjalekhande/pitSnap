# 00 - Paddock AI: Feature Brief

## Feature Intent

The "Paddock AI" is a suite of intelligent features designed to make the app a smarter, more insightful companion for every type of F1 fan. It acts as an expert assistant that can answer questions, provide factual context to conversations, and proactively offer relevant information.

## Core Experience

The Paddock AI will be integrated throughout the app in three key ways, with the first two being the initial priority:

1.  **"Ask the Paddock" (Priority 1)**: A dedicated, full-screen conversational AI where users can ask any question about F1—from simple rule clarifications to complex historical data—and receive instant, accurate answers.

2.  **"Smart Debates" (Priority 2)**: An AI assistant that can be tagged (e.g., `@PaddockAI`) within group chats. When tagged, it will provide factual, verifiable answers to questions, grounding user debates in real data and rules.

3.  **"Contextual Recommendations" (Future)**: The AI will proactively surface small, helpful cards of information throughout the app based on the user's current context. For example, explaining a pit stop strategy in the "Pit Wall" feed as it happens, or suggesting a historical article while a user views a driver's profile.

## Technical Goals

-   **RAG-Powered Core**: The AI will be built on a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model. This ensures answers are based on a curated knowledge base of F1 rulebooks, technical specs, race data, and news, preventing hallucinations.
-   **Seamless Integration**: The AI should feel like a natural part of the app, whether in a dedicated chat screen or as an assistant in a group conversation.
-   **Personalization**: The system will be designed with future personalization in mind, allowing it to tailor the complexity and focus of its answers to the user's knowledge level and interests.
